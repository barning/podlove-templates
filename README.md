# podlove-templates
My very own templates for Podlove Podcast Publisher

## Shortcodes
* For covers: `[podlove-template template="NAME OF THE TEMPLATE" episodes="NUMBER OF EPISODES" order="ASC OR DESC"]`
* To show members of a group: `[podlove-template template="NAME OF THE TEMPLATE"]`. Remember to create a group in the Podlove contributors tab and publish at least one episode with these contributors. Change the name of your Team in the template file (team.twig).
