# podlove-templates
My very own templates for Podlove Podcast Publisher

## Shortcodes
* For covers: `[podlove-template template="NAME OF THE TEMPLATE" episodes="NUMBER OF EPISODES" order="ASC OR DESC"]`
* For team.twig: Change the name of your Team in the template file. Remember to create a group in the Podlove contributors tab and publish at least one episode with these contributors.
